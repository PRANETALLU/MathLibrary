# MathLibrary

This is my (Eli Bradley's) computer science project, a Kotlin DSL focusing on various topics I've learned about
through school and just on my own. Moreover, this is the Kotlin implementation of the mathematical functionalities.
This includes:

- [X] Vector Algebra:
      There are operations, such as adding, subtracting, multipling, dividing vector coordinate points. Morever, we can
      calculate the angle between the two vector, projection angle, and rejection perspective. 
- [X] Multivariable Calculus
  - [X] Gradient Descent: It is used to calculate the minimization and maximimzation of functions. It is also known to be measured
  as a slope and heavily utilized in machine learning. The main purpose is to reduce the frequency of errors and work on
  efficiency. 
- [X] Basic Linear Algebra: Linear algebra is mainly based on the foundations of vectors, matrices, eignvectors, and their applications. This projct mainly
      emphasizes more on operations, transformations, and real-world examples when it comes to coding. 
- [X] Electrostatic Simulations: This is heavily based on physics concepts and utilizes a model to replicate the electric force and fields of a charged system. 
- [X] Analytic Transformations
  - [X] Taylor Series: The sum of expressions is usually in a series format / quotient. It is also used to calculate the approximation point of a function. 
  - [X] Fourier Series and Transformations: It is used to calculate periodic functions by utilizing the frequences of sin and cos functions. This is mainly used in filtering signals, audio processing, and image modifications. 
- [X] Complex Algebra
  - [X] Complex Numbers: This involves the operations between real and imaginary numbers. The format is a + bi. a is the real number, b is the complex number, and i is the imaginary number. 
  - [X] Complex Vectors: It is the between the interaction of two vectors, such as u and v. This involves vector operations, which include adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, and calculating the dot product. 
  - [X] Complex Matrices: Just like vectors, this involves basic operations, such as adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing. Moreover, additional operations could include inversion, transposition, and diagonolization. 
- [X] Quantum Computing
  - [X] Entangled Qubit States
  - [X] Quantum Gates
  - [X] Quantum Circuits
    - [X] Parallel Gates
    - [X] Sequential Gates
  - [X] Measuring: The state of qubit is used as a measuring tool when perfoming quantum operations. This manipulation of information is used to inteact with the simulation of quantum systems.
