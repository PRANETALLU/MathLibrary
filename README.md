# MathLibrary

This is my (Eli Bradley's) computer science project, a Kotlin DSL focusing on various topics I've learned about
through school and just on my own. Moreover, this is the Kotlin implementation of the mathematical functionalities.
This includes:

- [X] Vector Algebra
- [ ] Function methods:
- [ ] operator fun plus(other: DoubleVector) = super.plus(other).collapseToReal
    operator fun minus(other: DoubleVector) = super.minus(other).collapseToReal
    override operator fun times(other: Double) = super.times(other).collapseToReal
    override operator fun div(other: Double) = super.div(other).collapseToReal
    operator fun times(other: DoubleVector) = super.times(other).collapseToReal
    infix fun realDot(other: DoubleVector) = super.realDot(other).collapseToReal
