# MathLibrary

This is my (Eli Bradley's) computer science project, a Kotlin DSL focusing on various topics I've learned about
through school and just on my own. Moreover, this is the Kotlin implementation of the mathematical functionalities.
This includes:

- [X] Vector Algebra:
      There are operations, such as adding, subtracting, multipling, dividing vector coordinate points. Morever, we can
      calculate the angle between the two vector, projection angle, and rejection perspective. 
- [X] Multivariable Calculus
  - [X] Gradient Descent
- [X] Basic Linear Algebra
- [X] Electrostatic Simulations
- [X] Analytic Transformations
  - [X] Taylor Series
  - [ ] Fourier Series and Transformations
- [X] Complex Algebra
  - [X] Complex Numbers
  - [X] Complex Vectors
  - [X] Complex Matrices
- [X] Quantum Computing
  - [X] Entangled Qubit States
  - [X] Quantum Gates
  - [X] Quantum Circuits
    - [X] Parallel Gates
    - [X] Sequential Gates
  - [X] Measuring
